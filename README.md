***Description***: 
The “Gold-Mine Scout” chart uses simple, intuitive visual mappings to help you spot promising young talent at a glance. First, each player appears as a single circular mark positioned in two dimensions: age on the horizontal axis and potential rating on the vertical axis. This immediately lets you see which players are both young (further left) and have high upside (further up). Beyond position, the circles vary in two more ways. Their area encodes each player’s current overall rating—larger bubbles mean a higher current ability—so you can distinguish raw potential from demonstrated quality. At the same time, the fill color of each bubble comes from a continuous blue colormap: darker, richer blues indicate a higher simulated goals-plus-assists-per-90 metric. This hue/luminance channel highlights which up-and-coming players are already delivering on the pitch. To reduce visual clutter and help overlapping points stand out, every bubble is drawn semi-opaque (α≈0.8) and given a thin white border. The player’s name is also printed just above each bubble, so you don’t have to cross-reference a legend to know who’s who. Axes are kept minimal—light gray bottom spines with zero-length ticks and no gridlines—to focus attention on the data rather than chart decorations. Finally, two legends explain the encodings: a vertical colorbar at right for the goals+assists scale, and a small cluster of sample gray circles in the lower-right corner illustrating how bubble size translates to current rating values. Taken together, these marks and channels make

A stacked area chart showing how a teamâ€™s tactical identity evolves across quarters. The following KPIs are extracted from `Team_Attributes.csv` and normalized:

- **BuildUp Play Speed**: Speed of transition from defense to attack.
- **Defensive Pressure**: Aggressiveness in pressing opponents.
- **Defensive Line Height**: How high the defensive line holds its shape.

This chart helps reveal whether a team is becoming more aggressive, structured, or defensive over time.
